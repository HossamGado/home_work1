// If you need a variable that can hold any type of value and may change during
// execution, which data type would you use? Write a code example to show this.

//=> Dynamic data type because it depends on the type of data will come.


void main(){
  dynamic thing="Hossam"; //String
  print (thing);
  thing =20; //int
  print(thing);
}
